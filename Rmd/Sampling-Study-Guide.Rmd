# Sampling
Imagine you have some data on the weight of 1000 golden retriever dogs.  The weight of the dogs follows a normal distribution with a mean of 55, and a standard deviation of 10.

The histogram of looks like this.  Note where the mean is, and the Y-axis or frequency of the histogram.
```{r}
hist( dogs <- rnorm(1000, 55, 10))

summary(dogs)
```

Now you can use a subsample of the dogs data set.  Say you want a sample of 30 dogs, to check their mean weight.

```{r}
d30 <- sample(dogs, 30)
```

And then get a histogram of the sample size of 30.  Note the difference in mean, min and max between the data set for dogs and d30.

```{r}
summary(d30)
hist(d30)

```
