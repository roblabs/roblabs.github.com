## Galaxie 500

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxie_500)
> Galaxie 500 was an American alternative rock band that formed in 1987 and split up in 1991 after releasing three albums.

My liner notes
> Dreamy, beautiful, low fidelity and covers of George Harrison, New Order and The Velvet Underground.  Band members are still active in their own right.  Favorite cuts are *Strange* and the cover of *Ceremony*.
