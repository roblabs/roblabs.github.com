#### The Preserve

For outdoor enthusiasts, history buffs, photographers and artists, the southern "original" Mare Island Hill and Historic Shoreline is an unique parkland. On behalf of the Mare Island Heritage Trust, I invite you to hike, bike, explore, paint, contemplate, picnic and participate in tours, outings and events at the Mare Island Shoreline Heritage Preserve. Visit the Preserve open Friday through Sunday and holidays 10:00am-to one hour following sunset.

Within the Mare Island Shoreline Heritage Preserve is more than 150 years of U.S. Navy history, with a legacy of prior Spanish and Native American presence and remarkable natural and scenic elements. This site served as the Navy’s first Ammunition Depot in the Pacific, founded in 1857. The Navy’s oldest cemetery in the West and scenic vistas of seven counties from the hilltop are some of the special features. Since the Navy announced closure of Mare Island as an active military base in 1994, the City of Vallejo has planned for a regional park here. In 2002, the City received the first 100
acres from the State of California of this southern part of Mare Island that makes up the original true island before much of the rest of the navy base was developed through filling the bay, marshes and Napa River. The oldest group of ordnance storage magazines, the ordnance worker’s housing including the oldest residence on Mare Island and the Naval
Cemetery are designated as a National Historic District contributing to the Mare Island National Historic Landmark.

As an all volunteer group we are committed to providing for regular public use of the first phase of the regional park that includes the oldest naval cemetery in the Pacific, founded in 1858 and the 130 acres leading to the hilltop vista point. Access is through arrangements with the U.S. Navy and the City of Vallejo.

The Mare Island Shoreline Heritage Preserve is a 215-acre park located at the south end of Mare Island on land that formerly served as the U.S. Navy's first Naval Ammunition Depot, founded in 1857. Until we opened it for regularly scheduled access in April 2008, the land was off-limits to the public due to past sensitive Navy munitions production and storage operations and more recent environmental cleanup.

It takes a host of individuals, non-profit groups, agencies, local and regional businesses, corporations and foundations working together to realize the reuse of abandoned military property like this site as parkland.

Donations help fund Mare Island Heritage Trust support of the creation of the park and ongoing special events. It buys the sandpaper, paint, display boards, nails ... and all the other stuff that goes along with strong elbow grease. Whatever you can donate is appreciated. Note that we are one of a number of groups who offer outings, programs and events at The Preserve. Our efforts to open the property to the public on a limited, but regular basis for use as parklands are all volunteer.
