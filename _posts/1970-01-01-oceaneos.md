## Oceaneos
ePi Rational built an imaging & mapping pipeline for [Oceaneos.org](http://Oceaneos.org) that processed NASA satellite images to visualize trends in phytoplankton in the ocean.  Oceaneos is studying how ocean seeding can help improve the food chain by focusing on the bottom of the chain.  The satellite images span a 13 year window and there is an interactive map to see trends.  Amazing stuff.  

### Mapbox
NASA GeoTiffs were processed using GDAL and hosted at Mapbox.com.
* The design was to have a D3.js graph at the bottom which showed Chlorophyll levels over time.  
* When the user clicked on a particular date, the Mapbox map would also update to that time.  Therefore giving a visualization over time.

#### Raw Data from NASA

* The raw data from NASA comes from the NEO Server, [http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MY1DMM_CHLORA&date=2016-07-01](http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MY1DMM_CHLORA&date=2016-07-01)

#### Upload to Mapbox

* The Upload api is from Mapbox, and is a [Python based command line script](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-cli-py)
* Several files can uploaded at once and the status of uploads is monitored within the Mapbox account at http://Mapbox.com/studio
