## Oceaneos

Maps tell stories.  NASA satellite images of the *color* of the ocean hosted on Mapbox.com can also tell a story.  Now throw in a time series of NASA satellite images, some D3.js, some Plot.ly and you have a great way to visualize our oceans over time.


ePi Rational built an imaging & mapping pipeline for [Oceaneos.org](http://Oceaneos.org) that processed NASA satellite images to visualize trends in phytoplankton in the ocean.  Oceaneos is studying how ocean seeding can help improve the food chain by focusing on the bottom of the chain.  The satellite images span a 13 year window and there is an interactive map to see trends.

### More on Oceaneos
For further scientific details on Ocean Seeding and phytoplankton, please see the blog post at Oceaneos.

### Mapbox & Plot.ly
* NASA GeoTiffs were processed using [GDAL](http://gdal.org) and hosted at Mapbox.com.
* The implemented web page design is a [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/) time series graph at the bottom of the map which showed chlorophyll levels over a 13 year span.
* When the user clicked on a particular date, the Mapbox map would also update to that time.  Therefore giving a visualization over time.
  * Plotly.js `events` were captured and routed to [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/), which then makes updates to the map with images from Mapbox.com
* Built on top of [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [stack.gl](http://stack.gl/), plotly.js is a high-level, declarative charting library.



### Data from NASA

#### From the NASA Earth Observations (NEO) mission statement

*"Welcome to NASA Earth Observations (NEO)*

*One of the best places to study Earth is from space. NASA satellites continually orbit the globe, collecting information about Earth’s ocean, atmosphere, and land surfaces. Satellites can even monitor the activity of life forms, such as phytoplankton, from their remote vantage points.*

*NEO is part of the EOS Project Science Office located at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.""*

#### Raw Data

* The raw data from NASA comes from the NEO Server, [http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MY1DMM_CHLORA&date=2016-07-01](http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MY1DMM_CHLORA&date=2016-07-01)
* The images available in NEO are freely available for public use without further permission. ePi was diligent to credit NASA Earth Observations as the source in the Mapbox map.
* The [NASA satellite images ](http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/blog/2013/12/23/csv-and-floating-point-geotiffs) are sampled at these time series intervals
  *  One image per month.  Processing over a 13 year span would be approximately 120 RGB raster GeoTIFF images at 2 MB per image.
  *  One image every 8 days.  Processing over a 13 year span would be approximately 500 floating point GeoTIFF images at 3 MB per image.
* Oceaneos chose to compute their computations for the graph from statistics on the 8 day samples
* Computations of raw data was done from floating point GeoTIFFs using [Numerical Python](http://www.numpy.org/)
* The 8-day floating point GeoTIFFs were much smaller to download, and 10 times faster to process than the corresponding 8-day CSV data files

#### Upload to Mapbox

* The Upload api is from Mapbox, and is a [Python based command line script](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-cli-py)
* Several files can uploaded at once and the status of uploads is monitored within the Mapbox account at [Mapbox.com/studio](http://Mapbox.com/studio)
