## Oceaneos
ePi Rational built an imaging & mapping pipeline for [Oceaneos.org](http://Oceaneos.org) that processed NASA satellite images to visualize trends in phytoplankton in the ocean.  Oceaneos is studying how ocean seeding can help improve the food chain by focusing on the bottom of the chain.  The satellite images span a 13 year window and there is an interactive map to see trends.  Amazing stuff.  

### Mapbox
NASA GeoTiffs were processed using GDAL and hosted at Mapbox.com.

### More
For further scientific details on phytoplankton, please see the blog post at Oceaneos.
