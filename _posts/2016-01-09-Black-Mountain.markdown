## Paper Maps for Black Mountain.  Mobile app.

### Beta testing
Please fill out the web form and let us know
if you would like to test on Android or iOS.  For iOS will receive an email from Apple.  For Android you see the link.

* [Signup for the beta for iOS or Android][beta].  


### Prototypes
The way to have a good idea is to ___have many ideas___.  Here are some mobile web browser prototypes.  

* [Mapbox.js][Mapbox] — servers from Mapbox
* [Mapbox-gl.js][mapbox-gl-js] — Vector maps with a raster-to-vector overlay.
* [Mapbox.js + local path rasters][tilejson-local-server-github] — Similar to Mapbox.js, but raster tiles are served from a local relative path.
