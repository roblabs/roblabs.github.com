This GIF animation traces the path of the [Pacific Crest Trail](http://www.pcta.org), from the Mexican border near San Diego, to the Washington/British Columbia, Canada border.

The drawing tools are from [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com) and [LeafletJS](http://LeafletJS.com).

Since the video is about 45 seconds, the GIF files are fairly large.  So for better resolution, see the larger version.
