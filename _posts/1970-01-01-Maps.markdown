## Topographic Maps from US Forest Service or US Geologic Service

### A map — one of the ten essentials.

Anyone going to the back country needs a decent map.  Most outdoor stores sell 7.5 minute topographic maps (maps with contours).  But there are great online resources to download and buy topo maps.

#### Print Shops in San Diego

* [Mayer Reprographics][mayer] in North Park
* [RB Signs][rbsigns] in Rancho Bernardo

---

#### CalTopo.com
[CalTopo.com][caltopo] is a great resource for generating Geospatial PDFs.  You can center the map at your particular latitude/longitude instead of trying to span multiple quadrangles.  Then you get a URL that you can use to download your PDF for printing.

-----

#### United States Forest Service

The [USFS][usfs] has a site for downloading PDFs of their format called "FSTopo GeoPDFs".  These maps can be viewed any usual PDF reader and printed out.

This example of a GeoPDF shows the following

* The printed output side
* The product generation date
* UTM and latitude/longitude
* Legend, including adjoining quadrangles
* Scale and magnetic delcination are also on these maps
* The GeoPDF file size in MB

#### United States Geologic Survey

The [USGS][usgs] has a site that is a map locator and download site.  You can download 7.5 and 15 minute maps  

The USGS Topos have a different features set

* [US-Topo-Map-Symbols](../assets/pdf/US-Topo-Map-Symbols.pdf)
* A satellite image is included in the GeoPDF, making the file slightly larger
* If you wish to print with out the satellite, then you have to use a GeoPDF plugin to disable the image layer.
